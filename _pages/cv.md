## Short Bio
Since November 2024, I'm a postdoc researcher at the [Université de Strasbourg](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/), working with [Nalini Anantharaman](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~anantharaman/). Previously, I was an FSMP postdoc researcher for two years at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) under the mentorship of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/) (2022-2024). I completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) in July 2022. The research was conducted under the direction of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/). My [PhD thesis](https://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/thesis-arnaud-maret.pdf) is about totally elliptic representations of the fundamental group of a punctured sphere into $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. 

I conducted my bachelor studies at EPFL in Lausanne from 2013 to 2016 and completed my master at ETH in Zürich in 2018. My [master thesis](http://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/master_thesis.pdf), written under the supervision of [Will Merry](https://www.merry.io/), was about dynamics on intervals and surfaces. I studied forcing relations for the existence of periodic orbits in surface homeomorphisms.

During the time of my PhD, I was a member of the research programs [SFB/TRR 191 - Symplectic Structures in Geometry, Algebra and Dynamics](http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/CRC-TRR191/) and an associate member of  [GRK 2229 _Asymptotic Invariants and Limits of Groups and Spaces_](http://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/26.php). I was also a member of the Young Researchers Cluster affiliated with the [Cluster of Excellence STRUCTURES](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~structures/).
