## Short Bio
Since November 2022 I am a postdoc researcher at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en), working with [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/). I study character varieties of representations of surface groups and symplectic geometry. I am particularly interested in representations that are not part of any (higher) Teichmüller space and related conjectures such as Goldman's conjecture, Bowditch's question, etc.

I previously completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) in July 2022. The research was conducted under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/). My [PhD thesis](https://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/thesis-arnaud-maret.pdf) is about Deroin--Tholozan representations of the fundamental group of a punctured sphere into PSL(2,R). 

I conducted my bachelor studies at EPFL in Lausanne in 2016 and completed my master at ETH in Zürich in 2018. My [master thesis](http://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/master_thesis.pdf), written under the supervision of [Will Merry](https://www.merry.io/), was concerned with dynamics on intervals and surfaces. Namely the quest of a forcing relation for the existence of periodic orbits in surface homeomorphisms.

During the time of my PhD, I was a member of the research programs [SFB/TRR 191 - Symplectic Structures in Geometry, Algebra and Dynamics](http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/CRC-TRR191/) and an associate member of  [GRK 2229 _Asymptotic Invariants and Limits of Groups and Spaces_](http://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/26.php). I was also a member of the Young Researchers Cluster affiliated with the [Cluster of Excellence STRUCTURES](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~structures/).
