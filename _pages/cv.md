## Short CV

I obtained my bachelor at EPFL in Lausanne in 2016 and completed my master at ETH in ZÃ¼rich in 2018. My [master thesis](http://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/master_thesis.pdf), written under the supervision of [Will Merry](https://www.merry.io/), was concerned with dynamics in low dimensions. Namely the quest of a forcing relation for the existence of periodic orbits in surface homeomorphisms.

In connection to my PhD, I am a member of the research programs [GRK 2229 _Asymptotic Invariants and Limits of Groups and Spaces_](http://www.groups-and-spaces.kit.edu/26.php) and an associate member of [SFB/TRR 191 - Symplectic Structures in Geometry, Algebra and Dynamics](http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/CRC-TRR191/). I am also a member of the Young Researchers Cluster affiliated with the [Cluster of Excellence STRUCTURES](https://www.thphys.uni-heidelberg.de/~structures/).
