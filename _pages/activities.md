## Workshops (co)organized

  - **Workshop on Interplay between symplectic geometry and cluster theory**. IWH Heidelberg, January 2023 [[web page]](https://arnaudmaret.com/cluster/)

    **Abstract:** Cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2000 in the context of Lie theory. In the last twenty-two years the theory of cluster algebras gave life to several fascinating applications between different fields of mathematics such as quiver representations, Calabi-Yau categories, Teichm"uller theory, Poisson geometry, and many others.

An interesting example stems from the work of Vianna, where a connection between Markov triples and not Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangian tori is established. Motivated by this result, we would like to further understand the relations between cluster structures, quiver representations and almost toric fibrations.

The aim of this workshop was to gain a deeper understanding of these interplay thanks to three mini-courses held by experts as well as some research talks. The IWH will provide us with a charming environment for discussions towards further explorations and perspectives.
  - **Young Researcher's Workshop on Positivity in Lie Groups**. IWH Heidelberg, January 2022 [[web page]](https://arnaudmaret.com/positivity/) [[proceedings]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04339)

    **Abstract:** The aim of this workshop was to understand the notion of total positivity and Theta-positivity and how it relates to Higher Teichmüller theory. Theta-positivity is a notion of positivity in semisimple Lie groups and was recently introduced by Guichard and Wienhard in Positivity and higher Teichmüller theory as a generalization of Lusztig’s total positivity.
