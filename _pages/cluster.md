### what? 
The aim of this workshop is to understand some constructions in symplectic geometry that show a structure of cluster algebra. An example is [the work of Vianna](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2850) on Lagrangian tori in CP^2 and its relation with Markov triples.

The workshop is aimed at graduate students and senior scientists interested in the topic. There will be two minicourses and a couple of research talks.

### when? 
The workshop took place from **January 16th to 18th, 2023** at the [IWH Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/iwh/).

### who?

Confirmed speakers: Jonny Evans (minicourse), Felix Schlenk (minicourse)

The main organizers of the workshop are [Arnaud Maret](http://arnaudmaret.com/), [Maria Bertozzi](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ffm/Lehrstuehle/Algebra/mbertozzi.html.en) and Alexandre Jannaud. 

We gratefully acknowledge funding from the [CRC/TRR 191](http://www.mi.uni-koeln.de/CRC-TRR191/index.php?dom=home&page=main).
