## what? 
Cluster algebras were introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2000 in the context of Lie theory. In the last twenty-two years the theory of cluster algebras gave life to several fascinating applications between different fields of mathematics such as quiver representations, Calabi-Yau categories, Teichm\"uller theory, Poisson geometry, and many others.

An interesting example stems from [the work of Vianna](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2850), where a connection between Markov triples and not Hamiltonian isotopic Lagrangian tori is established.
Motivated by this result, we would like to further understand the relations between cluster structures, quiver representations and almost toric fibrations.

The aim of this workshop is to gain a deeper understanding of these interplay thanks to three mini-courses held by experts as well as some research talks. The IWH will provide us with a charming environment for discussions towards further explorations and perspectives. 

The workshop is aimed at graduate students and senior scientists interested in the topic. There will be *three minicourses and a six research talks*. You can download the abstract [here](http://arnaudmaret.github.io/files/cluster-abstract.pdf).
