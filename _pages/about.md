## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher of mathematics at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in the group [Analyse complexe et Géométrie](https://www.imj-prg.fr/acg/) under the supervision of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/).

I completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) in Germany under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/) in July 2022.

**I am currently on the job market to start a new position in the fall 2024.**

Research areas that particularly motivate me include representations of surface groups, (higher) Teichmüller Theory, symplectic geometry, (complex)
hyperbolic geometry, and dynamics on character varieties.

In parallel with my work as a researcher, I am also active in the world of Mathematical Olympiad.
