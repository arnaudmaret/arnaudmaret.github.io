#About me

My name is Arnaud.

Since September 2018 I have been working as a PhD student of mathematics at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/). 

I work in symplectic geometry. My interest concerns the symplectic structure of representation varieties.
