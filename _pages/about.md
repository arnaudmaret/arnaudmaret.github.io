## About me

I recently completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/). Starting in November, I will be a postdoc researcher at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in the group [Analyse complexe et Géométrie](https://www.imj-prg.fr/acg/) under the supervision of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/).

Research areas that particularly motivate me include character varieties, symplectic geometry, and dynamical systems.

In parallel with my studies, I work as academic director for the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad.
