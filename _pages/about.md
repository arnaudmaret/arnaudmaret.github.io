## About me

I'm currently a postdoc in the reserach group of [Nalini Anantharaman](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~anantharaman/) at the Université de Strasbourg.

Until November 2024, I was an FSMP postdoctoral researcher of mathematics at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in the group [Analyse complexe et Géométrie](https://www.imj-prg.fr/acg/) under the supervision of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/).

I completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) in Germany under the direction of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/) in July 2022.

Research areas that particularly motivate me include representations of surface groups and character varieties, (higher) Teichmüller Theory, symplectic geometry, (complex)
hyperbolic geometry, and dynamics on character varieties.

In parallel with my work as a researcher, I am also active in the world of Mathematical Olympiad.
