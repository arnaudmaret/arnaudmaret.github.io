## About me

I am a postdoctoral researcher of mathematics at the [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) in the group [Analyse complexe et Géométrie](https://www.imj-prg.fr/acg/) under the supervision of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/).

I completed my PhD at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) in Germany under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/) in July 2022.

Research areas that particularly motivate me include character varieties (of surface group representations), symplectic geometry (of character varieties), and dynamical systems (such as mapping class group dynamics on character varieties).

In parallel with my work as a researcher, I am also active in the world of Mathematical Olympiad.
