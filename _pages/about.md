## About me

Since September 2018 I have been working as a PhD student of mathematics at the [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/) under the supervison of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/). 

Research areas that particularly motivate me include symplectic geometry, dynamical systems and surface group representations.

In parallel with my studies, I work as academic director for the Swiss Mathematical Olympiad.
