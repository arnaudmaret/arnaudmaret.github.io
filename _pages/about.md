## About me

I am currently a postdoc in the reserach group of [Nalini Anantharaman](https://irma.math.unistra.fr/~anantharaman/) at the Université de Strasbourg, funded by the European Union.

Until November 2024, I was an FSMP postdoc at Sorbonne Université in the group [Analyse complexe et Géométrie](https://www.imj-prg.fr/acg/) under the supervision of [Julien Marché](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~julien.marche/). I completed my PhD in July 2022 at the University of Heidelberg under the direction of [Peter Albers](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~palbers/) and [Anna Wienhard](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~wienhard/).

Research areas that particularly motivate me include low dimensional geometry and topology, surface groups representations and character varieties,
(higher) Teichmüller Theory, symplectic geometry, (complex) hyperbolic geometry, mapping class groups and dynamics on character varieties.

In parallel with my work as a researcher, I am also active in the world of Mathematical Olympiad.
