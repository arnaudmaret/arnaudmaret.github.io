### what? 
The aim of this workshop is to understand the notion of total positivity and Theta-positivity and how it relates to Higher Teichmüller theory. Theta-positivity is a notion of positivity in semisimple Lie groups and was recently introduced by Guichard and Wienhard in [Positivity and higher Teichmüller theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02833) as a generalization of Lusztig's total positivity.

The workshop is aimed at graduate students that are interested in the topic. Every participant will play an active role in the seminar - either by preparing a talk, or by organizing an exercise session to consolidate what has been learned.

### when? 
January 10th to 14th 2022

### where? 
[IWH Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/einrichtungen/iwh/)

### how?
Travel to Heidelberg is simple by train or by plane to Frankfurt am Main, which is an hour away by train from Heidelberg. All talks will take place at IWH. To get to the IWH from the main station (Heidelberg Hbf), take the bus 20 direction Karlsplatz for 12 minutes, get off at Karlsplatz and walk 3 minutes to IWH. There are also other bus options which might involve longer trips on the bus or longer walking. 

Accomodation for all participants will be provided at IWH in double rooms. We have limited funding to reimburse travel costs. 

### who?
