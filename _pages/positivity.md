# what? 
The aim of this workshop is to understand the notion of total positivity and Theta-positivity and how it relates to Higher Teichmüller theory. Theta-positivity is a notion of positivity in semisimple Lie groups and was recently introduced by Guichard and Wienhard in [Positivity and higher Teichmüller theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02833) as a generalization of Lusztig's total positivity.

The workshop is aimed at graduate students that are interested in the topic. Every participant will play an active role in the seminar - either by preparing a talk, or by organizing an exercise session to consolidate what has been learned.
